## FACEBOOK CACHE VALIDATOR

 - Requests a link or multiple links for the Facebook API to "scrape." This usually isn't necessary since Facebook's API will scrape  a webpage when it's shared for the first time; however, if the page is updated within 30 days after it's first share, that page's cache would not update until 30 days after the first share or until this script is ran.

- Technologies used:
	- Java (8.0) Programming Language
	- JSoup
	- Facebook API (restFB)
